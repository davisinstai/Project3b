## Project Description

The goals of this assignment are:
* To analyze corpora, especially focusing on sentences.
* To learn more about NLP.

Here are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:
1. From moodle, accept the assignment. Open and set up a code space (install a python kernel and select it).
2. Complete the notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to answer all questions, and to commit the notebook in a "run" state!
3. I wrote the comments; you write the code! Complete and run `spacy_on_corpus.py` following the instructions in this notebook.
4. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name, your class year, links to/descriptions of any extensions and a list of resources. 
5. Commit your code often. We will take the last commit before the deadline as your submission of the project.

Possible extensions (from least points to most points):
* Augment the function `render_doc_statistics` so that it also includes some sentence and noun chunk statistics.
* Look at the displaCy docs (https://spacy.io/api/top-level#displacy_options). Make the visualizations of the dependency parses more elegant or functional.
* Allow the user to choose an individual document. Save all the visualizations of the sentence parses into a file.
* Your other ideas are welcome! If you'd like to discuss one with Dr Stent, feel free.
